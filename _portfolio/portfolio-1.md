title: "Project 1: StarAngle"

Technologies used: MATLAB, GNU Radio, Python.

This is my current research project in which I created my own Starlink receiver using a USRP B210 and a commercial of the shelf universal LNB, in order to receive beacon signals transmitted by Starlink satellites. These beacon signals are then used to analyze the orientation of the user. 
Submitted to SenSys 2024.
