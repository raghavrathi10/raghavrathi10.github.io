I am a recent PhD graduate from the Florida State University (Class of 2024), where I worked under the guidance of [Dr. Zhenghao Zhang](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/department/faculty/zzhang/). 

🔬 My research interests are in Wireless Communication, Low Power Wide Area Networks(LPWAN) and Satellite Communication.

📚 I have worked on projects related to starlink and LoRa technology. My most resent project [StarAngle](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3666025.3699367), we used the beacon signals transmitted by starlink satellites to calculate user orientation.

👾 Along with the PhD research, I have always been an active member of the FSU CTF team [Nol3ptr](https://ctftime.org/team/2524/) where we participated in weekly CTF competitions hosted all over the world.
